  <h1>Copyright</h1>
  <p>
    I agree with copyright because it prevents your general idea from being stolen. While it does allow people to make similar items, that will make it so you can't overcharge people just because you want to overcharge them. It's important to make sure consumers have a diversity of similar goods and services while allowing you to keep your idea out there.
